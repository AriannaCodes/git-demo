Quick Git tutorial
------------------
This guide is designed to be used as a quick tutorial on Git for those new to it or anyone who just needs a refresher.  We'll cover the basics of committing, branches, and pull requests.
First, if you don't have a GitHub account yet, go to github.com and sign up for an account.  Once you're done, visit github.com/kevinzhang96/git-demo, and hit "Fork" on the top right.  This creates a copy of this repository for your own use; you'll be able to pull updates from this repository while making changes to your own copy.  Once you're done, visit your own copy.
